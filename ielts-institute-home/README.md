## 🎨 Design Choices

* **Modern UI**: Used Tailwind CSS for clean, utility-first styling and ensured all sections have consistent spacing, colors, and typography.
* **Hero Section Animation**: Added **Framer Motion** to animate the headline and button for an engaging first impression.
* **Component-based Structure**: Navbar, Hero, Features, Testimonials, and Footer are separated for clarity and scalability.
* **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile screens using Tailwind’s responsive classes.
* **Professional Look**: Neutral background with a blue accent color to convey trust, learning, and professionalism.
